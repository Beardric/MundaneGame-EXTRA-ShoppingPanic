README v1.0

=====

Thanks for downloading one of my models, I appreciate it. I used Sketchup 2017 to create the geometry and convert to DAE. I give complete 
permission for this object to be used in commercial and non-commercial builds however credit must be issued for the object. Along with this, 
you agree not to upload this model anywhere and claim it as your own. This model will always remain free and will remain in Sketchfab. If you 
enjoy my work and would like something custom made, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Thanks again, Logansryche
